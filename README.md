# PatchThat

## Introduction

Welcome to PatchThat, the easy way to find out what your system is running and what needs to be patched! Manage your programs and services with ease and make everything transparentâ€”but transparent only to you. This README document is for detailed and clear documentation for the intended use of this product and its implemented services. If there is anything you think is missing or incomplete, please message us!

## Proof of Value

Proof of Value tests can be found in the repository under [docs/PoVTests](docs/PoVTests). You can view the latest additions/test [here](docs/PoVTests/Test3-Sep292024.md).

## Features

The features implemented in this app are always growing and expanding, and should continue to do so as technology continues to evolve and as we attempt to give the clearest view possible of what is happening in your computer. This program is intended to work with all major operating systems (Windows, Mac, and Linux). Right now, we have these features implemented:

- Application and service scanning that outputs the default terminal output of these commands (based on your OS):
  - Windows: `tasklist`
  - Mac: `launchctl list`
  - Linux: `systemctl list-units --type=service --all --no-pager`
- Output is formatted into JSON text to make for a cleaner display and help with further analysis in upcoming releases.

We also have these features that we intend to implement in our upcoming sprints:

- Further formatting of output for an easier reading experience.
- Checking installed versions against posted newest versions.
- Analyzing local Python environments for installed library versions.
- Analyzing Node.js projects and the versions for their installed dependencies.

## Installation

Right now, the best way to install the project is to clone the repository and run `npm install` followed by `npm run start`. We plan to further implement features for creating distributable installers using packages like _Electron Forge_ or _electron-builder_ and some installers have been uploaded (the can be found under the [Releases/Tags](https://github.com/sethbr11/patchthat/tags) section of the repository), though proper installation of these require developer accounts and certificates for Windows and Mac, which accounts and certificates we do not have. There are workarounds to this to allow the application to run on your computer, which workarounds can be found below.

For installation via cloning the repository, follow the steps below:

1. Create a folder in the location you would like to install the project.
2. In your terminal, type `git clone https://github.com/sethbr11/patchthat.git .` (don't forget the "."; this tells git to not create another folder within the folder you already created).
3. Go into the project with `cd patchthat/patchthat` (the first patchthat folder contains the project and docs).
4. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) on the computer if not already installed. On Linux, you can run `sudo apt get npm`
5. Run `npm install` to install dependencies for the project.
6. Duplicate the _local_settings.json.base_ file located in the settings folder and rename the duplicate to _local_settings.json_.
7. Run the program with `npm run start`, typed in the terminal.
   - If you are trying to run on Linux and are getting errors, you may need to update permissions from chrome-sandbox as part of your electron dependencies.This can be done by running `sudo chown root:root /home/.../patchthat/patchthat/node_modules/electron/dist/chrome-sandbox` followed by `sudo chmod 4755 /home/.../patchthat/patchthat/node_modules/electron/dist/chrome-sandbox` (replacing "..." with your specific path). You can then check that it worked with `ls -l /home/.../patchthat/patchthat/node_modules/electron/dist/chrome-sandbox`.

To get around the MacOS protections while opening the installer, you will have to create your own certificate. The steps for creating your own are as follows:

1. Open the _Keychain Access_ app.
2. Click on the app name in the top menu and go to _Certificate Assistant_. From there, click _Create a Certificate..._
3. Name the certificate something like **PatchThatAppCertificate** and change the certificate type to **Code Signing**. Press Create to finish.
4. To make sure it saved, you should see it in _Keychain Access_ under the _login_ section of _Default Keychains_ after navigating to _My Certificates_.
5. Download the dmg file for the app from the releases section. Run the dmg to install the app.
6. Open the terminal and navigate to the Application folder where the downloaded app is saved. This should be in the very base directory and not the Application folder under your user directory.
7. Run the following commands in the terminal:

- `xattr -cr patchthat.app` (removes all extended attributes, including metadata and Finder information, from the specified file or directory and its contents).
- `codesign --deep --force --sign "PatchThatAppCertificate" patchthat.app` (applies the certificate).

8. Run the app as normal!

## Usage

At the current state of the project, when you open the app it will display a very basic page with a button that says "Scan Services". It may also open up with DevTools up, which you can close or investigate if you are interested (there's not much there). From there, the only functionality is pressing the button and examining the output that shows services and versions. If on Mac, the status code may be of interest while looking at the services: status code 0 means the process is running normally, status code 9 means the process has been terminated, status code 1 means the process stopped but with an error, and status code -6 means the process was aborted (usually an internal issue or deliberate termination due to fatal errors).
