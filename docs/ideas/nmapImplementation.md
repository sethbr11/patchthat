Running Nmap within an Electron application without installing it on the host machine can be challenging, but it's possible using a few approaches. Here are some options:

### 1. Bundling Nmap with Your Electron App

You can bundle a portable version of Nmap with your Electron app. Here’s how you can do it:

- Download Portable Nmap: Get a portable version of Nmap that doesn't require installation. This will usually be in a zip file.
- Include Nmap in Your Project: Place the extracted Nmap files in a directory within your Electron application (e.g., resources/nmap).
- Run Nmap from Your App: Use Node.js's child_process module to spawn Nmap from the bundled directory. Here’s a quick example:

  ```js
  const { execFile } = require('child_process');
  const path = require('path');

  const nmapPath = path.join(\_\_dirname, 'resources', 'nmap', 'nmap.exe');

  execFile(nmapPath, ['-sP', '192.168.1.1/24'], (error, stdout, stderr) => {
    if (error) {
      console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
      return;
    }
    if (stderr) {
      console.error(`stderr: ${stderr}`);
      return;
    }
    console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`);
  });
  ```

### 2. Using a Virtual Environment

If your application allows for more complexity, you could consider running Nmap in a containerized environment (like Docker):

- **Docker Container:** Create a Docker container with Nmap installed.
- **Electron App Communication**:\*\* Use your Electron app to communicate with the Docker container via an API or local socket.

### 3. Use WebAssembly (WASM)

If you find a way to compile Nmap or a similar network scanning tool to WebAssembly (WASM), you could run it directly in the browser context of the Electron app. However, this approach might be complex and could have limitations compared to the native version.
